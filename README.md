# Jailbreak
 jeal break game with two characters moving simultaneously
Controls:
wasd or arrow keys to move
f to interact
shift to sneak
space to swap for now, but soon it'll be time base

Game Flow:
The game has two phases: the green phase and the blue phase. 
Green Phase:
In the green phase, there's a time limit in which the player has to get the green character to interact with the goal. Enemies can see the character, but the player won't lose in this phase. In this phase the player can unlock doors, but cannot interact with enemies. When the green character interacts with the goal, the player switches to the blue phase. There is a time limit, so the player will have to move quickly in this phase. That means that they will probably get caught by at least one enemy.
Blue Phase:
In the blue phase, time resets to the beginning of the green phase. The green character carries out the actions that the player took with it while the player controls the green character. Now the goal is to knock out any enemies before they spot the green character without getting spotted yourself. In this phase, if either character is spotted, the player loses the game. To win the game or move on to the next level, the player needs to interact with the goal first with the blue guy after the green guy interacts with it in the blue phase.
