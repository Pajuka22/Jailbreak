# Jailbreak
 jeal break game with two characters moving simultaneously
Controls:
wasd or arrow keys to move
f to interact
shift to sneak
space to swap for now, but soon it'll be time base

Game Flow:
the green guy goes first, followed by the blue guy. The green guy can unlock doors and interact with the win condition box. Enemies can see the player while they're controlling the green guy, but the player won't lose. Once the green guy interacts with the box, the player can control the blue guy, and time resets to when the green guy started. The green guy then does all the actions the player did with that character while the blue guy does his thing. This guy can knock out enemies. The blue guy will have a time limit, so not getting caught by any guards would be almost impossible. As a result, the blue guy needs to knock out the enemies that spotted the blue guy, and i'm planning on putting timers over the heads of enemies that will spot the green guy. The goal is to have the blue guy interact with the box and then the green guy. kinda like a locked, rusty door. you gotta pick the lock then smack it real hard.
